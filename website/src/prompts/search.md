## web search

You have at your disposal a googleSearch tool to get a list of search results (with url) using Google

After you fetch the results also get the content of the respective urls if they are relevant

REMEMBER
- use gitchamber.com to fetch Github urls (if you find a repo fetch the repo files and then README.md to read what the project is about)
