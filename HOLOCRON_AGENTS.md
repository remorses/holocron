To research fumadocs you can fetch https://fumadocs.dev/llms-full.txt

Optionally grep for what you need with curl https://fumadocs.dev/llms-full.txt | grep 'search term'

You can also search for files in the folder fumadocs to do the same thing


when testing docs-website and need to curl a website do not simply use localhost:777. instead first find a host actually used. see docs-dev/holocron.jsonc for domains that can be used like holocron-ysx261dl.localhost
